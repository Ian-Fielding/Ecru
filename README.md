# Ecru
Ecru is an in-progress interactive, functional mathematics sandbox that doubles as a workspace and a computer algebra system. Many other CASs and graphing utilities I've used over the years have felt clunky and unituitive, and a lot of the time they never felt to me like they struck the proper balance between being "math"y and "programming"y, by which I mean that over the years studying mathematics and programming I've found myself jumping back and forth between a number of programs and wasting a lot of time converting the same data from one to another. Ecru will (hopefully) be a more integrated solution to these problems.
