# Ecru
Ecru is an in-progress interactive, functional mathematics sandbox that doubles as a workspace and a computer algebra system. Many other CASs and graphing utilities I've used over the years have felt clunky and unituitive, and a lot of the time they never felt to me like they struck the proper balance between being "math"y and "programming"y, by which I mean that over the years studying mathematics and programming I've found myself jumping back and forth between a number of programs and wasting a lot of time converting the same data from one to another. Ecru will (hopefully) be a more integrated solution to these problems.

## Progress

 - [ ] Design and implement expression normal form
 - [ ] Refactor and clean code
 - [ ] Implement usable UI
 - [ ] Create testing program
 - [X] Implement pattern/term replacement algorithm
 - [X] Handle the binding and replacement of variables
 - [X] Complete the expression scanner and parser
